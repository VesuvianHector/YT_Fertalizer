# YT_Fertalizer
YT_Fertalizer is probably the best way to combat YouTubes botting detection system by allowing for multiple windows with real view times and logging in with multiple accounts you have to make.
 to use YT_Fertalizer you will need to create multiple bot accounts or just one and add them to the lists under the in program option "modify lists". then you will have to add the exact link to the videos you want to "bot" views,likes, and soon comments(shouldn't be long)
 in order to use YT_Fertalizer you will need to have the selenium module for python downloaded https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/seleniumhq.github.io/blob/dev/LICENSE (their licensing and I highly recomend you learn how to use this wonderful module and application) and set up the chrome driver webbrowser https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ here and add it to the corrisponding folder i have in the source code.
 if youre on most Linux distros setting up the chrome driver can be a bit of a pain just use mv to move it to the right folder when you're sudo/root as it is needed for that folder.
 this is nowhere a finished or completed projectbut i decided to get a working version done.
